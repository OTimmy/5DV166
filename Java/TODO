1. Messageque for the model to send to controller and therefrom to the gui.
  - Should be used in,
    -Network


2. Network.java
   Max size of pud should be 1500 bytes, becuase of internet thread.

3. ErrorListener
   Implement consumer and producere, where as  produce produce error messages, and consumer ( at controller) prints messages.

4. hostname
   // http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/core-java/net/inetaddress/get-hostname-from-ip-address/

5. Input stream, (fromInputStream function)

6. Think of how data should be returned, for example the data from slist.
   - What so ever informaiton, should be printed , even though it's not complete.
     And a thread should be running in a aloop til every thing is collected.

7. Network class, should manage the classes NetworkUDP. Like to start threads
   And stop them, and return data.

8. GUI should say x/total number of servers, while printing servers


9. Sequence number, figure out how to apply it correctly, and if every pdu that's been sent has one, or theres only one per getlist??

10. When refres is made, a thread will be running a while loop tills any new data arrives, from the thread reciving from udp socket. Or that the correct number of servers is accounted for.

11. What if multiple refresh actions are made?? Should previous thread terminate?? And restart??
   -- If multiple are made, then previous refresh should be cancelled before any new one is made. 
   
12. Thread should be notified if any data is ready to be printed...
